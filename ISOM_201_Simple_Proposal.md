# ISOM 201: Business Decisions with AI
## Proposal for Core Curriculum Redesign

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Opportunity:** Update ISOM 201 to provide universal AI literacy for all business students, addressing Task Force concerns about declining relevance while implementing Suffolk's published SAIL Framework.

**The Solution:** One course, ISOM-taught, with universal AI foundations (Weeks 1-4) followed by major-specific project applications (Weeks 5-13). Marketing students work on marketing AI problems, finance students on finance problems, etc.

**The Impact:** Every SBS graduate becomes AI-literate in their chosen field, positioning Suffolk as a leader in AI-era business education.

**Timeline:** Launch Fall 2026 after one-year development and pilot refinement.

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Current Challenges

**From Task Force Feedback:**
- ISOM 319 flagged as having "declining relevance to core business foundation"
- Advisory boards concerned about content "at risk of automation"
- Core curriculum needs updating to reflect modern business realities

**From Industry Trends:**
- 644% increase in job postings requiring generative AI skills (Educational Advisory Board)
- 70% of knowledge jobs require basic AI literacy, not advanced technical skills
- Employers need graduates who can direct AI tools, not compete against them

**From Students:**
- Need AI literacy regardless of major (marketing, finance, accounting, management, ISOM)
- Want relevant, practical skills for AI-driven workplace
- Seek differentiation in competitive job market

### The Strategic Question

**How do we prepare every business student to lead with AI, not be replaced by it?**

---

## THE SOLUTION

### Course Overview

**ISOM 201: Business Decisions with AI** equips all business students with foundational AI literacy through Suffolk's SAIL Framework (Social Intelligence, AI Literacy, Innovation/Inquiry, Leadership).

**Structure:**
- **Weeks 1-4:** Universal AI foundations (all students together)
- **Weeks 5-13:** Major-specific project applications (differentiated by major)
- **Week 14:** Cross-functional integration and presentations

**Teaching:** ISOM faculty, multiple sections per semester (like current core courses)

**Credits:** 3

**Prerequisites:** SBS 101 (Business Foundations)

---

## THE SAIL FRAMEWORK

Suffolk's published framework (AACSB Insights, October 2025) provides the structure for AI literacy:

### Four Pillars

**üß† AI Literacy** *(How does it work?)*
- Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- Prompt engineering and effective AI tool use
- When different AI approaches work and why
- Technical concepts without requiring programming

**üîç Innovation/Inquiry** *(What's missing or wrong?)*
- Questioning AI outputs critically
- Identifying bias and hidden assumptions
- "Wait, that's weird" methodology
- Validating AI recommendations against business reality

**ü§ù Social Intelligence** *(How do we connect?)*
- Communicating about AI to diverse stakeholders
- Translating technical findings for non-technical audiences
- Building trust in AI-driven decisions
- Collaborating across technical and business teams

**üëë Leadership** *(Should we do this?)*
- Ethical frameworks for AI deployment
- Assessing stakeholder impact and unintended consequences
- Deciding when NOT to use AI

## ADDRESSING ANTICIPATED CONCERNS

### "Can ISOM faculty really teach marketing/finance/accounting AI applications?"

**Response:**
- Faculty teach SAIL Framework (leadership, critical thinking, ethics, communication)
- Domain content comes from strong cases and guest speakers
- Projects evaluated on SAIL competencies, not domain expertise
- Like teaching statistics with business examples - don't need to be domain expert
- "Project Playbooks" provide structured guidance for each domain

**Evidence:**
- Many faculty successfully teach cross-functional cases
- MBA faculty often teach outside narrow specialty
- The differentiator is teaching AI literacy, not domain content

---

### "Won't projects be inconsistent quality across domains?"

**Response:**
- All projects assessed using same SAIL rubric
- Regular instructor coordination meetings ensure calibration
- Shared project playbooks provide consistent scaffolding
- Annual review process identifies and addresses gaps
- Start with fewer domains (3-4) then expand as we refine

**Mitigation:**
- Strong project templates and examples
- Clear rubrics and anchor student work
- Faculty development focused on consistent assessment
- Continuous improvement process

---

### "How is this different from old ISOM 201?"

**Response:**
**Old ISOM 201:** Technical tools (optimization, regression, forecasting)
**New ISOM 201:** AI leadership (directing tools, questioning outputs, ethical decisions)

**Key differences:**
1. Framework: SAIL pillars structure the entire course
2. Focus: Leadership and judgment, not just technical execution
3. Tools: Generative AI and modern platforms, not just spreadsheets
4. Application: Students apply to their domain, not generic problems
5. Skills: Future-proof meta-skills, not specific techniques at risk of automation

**This is substantive redesign, not just adding "AI" to course title**

---

### "Is this too ambitious? Should we start smaller?"

**Response:**
- We've simplified from more complex multi-track design
- Current design is essentially: universal foundations + differentiated projects
- This is standard pedagogy (like capstone courses with topic choices)
- Piloting in Fall 2026 allows refinement before full rollout
- Can start with 3 project domains and add more as we gain confidence

**Not ambitious - it's appropriately scaled for one-year development**

---

### "What if students choose wrong major for projects?"

**Response:**
- Students work in teams with others from their major
- If student changes major, they've still learned transferable SAIL competencies
- Projects are about applying framework, not deep specialization
- Flexibility: undecided students can choose any domain
- This isn't locking students in, just providing relevant context

---

### "What about faculty who don't feel AI-competent?"

**Response:**
- Comprehensive faculty development program (Summer 2026)
- Shared resources and support structures
- Start with volunteer faculty who are interested
- Others can join as they build confidence
- No one forced to teach new version until ready
- Ongoing support through coordination meetings

**Plus:** Many ISOM faculty already using AI tools and generative AI - we're systematizing what some already do
