# ISOM 201: Business Decisions with AI
## One-Page Executive Summary

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Update ISOM 201 to provide universal AI literacy for all business students, addressing Task Force concerns about declining relevance while implementing Suffolk's published SAIL Framework.

---

## THE SIMPLE SOLUTION

**One course. ISOM-taught. Two phases.**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Universal AI Literacy** - All students learn together
- What is AI and how does it work (conceptually)
- Suffolk's SAIL Framework: Social Intelligence, AI Literacy, Innovation/Inquiry, Leadership
- Ethical decision-making with AI
- Critical evaluation of AI outputs

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-13): Major-Specific Projects** - Students work in domain teams
- Marketing students: AI for customer analytics and campaigns
- Finance students: AI for risk assessment and portfolios
- Accounting students: AI for audit and fraud detection
- Management students: AI for strategic decisions
- ISOM students: Technical AI implementation

**Same class, same instructor, different applications.**

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

### Simple & Implementable
- ISOM faculty teach (like any core course)
- Standard project-based pedagogy
- One year development timeline
- Launch Fall 2026

### Serves All Students
- Every student gets AI literacy
- Everyone applies it to their major
- Domain-relevant, not generic
- Prepares for AI-driven careers

### Strategically Strong
- Implements SAIL Framework (our published approach)
- Addresses "declining relevance" concern directly
- Differentiates SBS: "Every graduate is AI-literate in their field"
- Positions Suffolk as leader in AI education

### Low Risk
- Building on current ISOM H201 pilot
- ISOM controls quality and delivery
- No complex cross-departmental dependencies
- Can refine based on Fall 2026 pilot

## KEY FACTS

**Industry Need:**
- 644% increase in job postings requiring AI skills (Educational Advisory Board)
- 70% of knowledge jobs need basic AI literacy
- Employers need graduates who can direct AI, not just use it

**What Students Learn:**
- How to effectively prompt and direct AI tools
- How to question and validate AI outputs
- How to communicate about AI to stakeholders
- How to make ethical decisions about AI deployment

**Assessment:**
All projects evaluated using same SAIL rubric:
- AI Literacy: Tool selection and effective use
- Innovation/Inquiry: Critical questioning and validation
- Social Intelligence: Communication to diverse audiences
- Leadership: Ethical considerations and stakeholder impact

## SAMPLE PROJECTS BY MAJOR

| Major | Project Focus | SAIL Application |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Marketing** | AI-driven customer segmentation | Question bias in targeting; present to marketing vs. exec team; address privacy ethics |
| **Finance** | Credit risk assessment with AI | Validate model assumptions; communicate to investors vs. regulators; ensure lending fairness |
| **Accounting** | Fraud detection patterns | Test for false positives; present to audit committee vs. staff; maintain professional responsibility |
| **Management** | AI adoption strategy | Question implementation risks; communicate change to stakeholders; manage workforce impact |
| **ISOM** | Predictive model development | Deep technical validation; explain to non-technical users; ensure responsible ML |

**Different content, same competencies developed.**

## IMPLEMENTATION

**Spring 2026:** Development
- Refine based on ISOM H201 pilot
- Create "Project Playbooks" for each domain
- Faculty development workshop

**Fall 2026:** Pilot Launch
- 2-3 sections with volunteer faculty
- Monitor and refine
- Gather evidence of effectiveness

**Spring 2027:** Expansion
- 4-6 sections based on demand
- Incorporate learnings
- Build resource library

**Fall 2027+:** Full Implementation
- All incoming students
- Continuous improvement
- Annual updates

---

## RESOURCES NEEDED

**Minimal Incremental Cost:**
- ✅ Free software (generative AI, Google Colab, domain tools)
- ✅ Standard classrooms
- ✅ Standard ISOM teaching load

**Investments:**
- Course coordinator stipend or reduced load (1 course equivalent)
- Faculty development workshop (Summer 2026)
- Project playbook development time
- Guest speakers (mostly volunteer)

---

## STRATEGIC IMPACT

**For Students:**
- AI literacy in their chosen field
- Competitive advantage in job market
- Future-proof skills that grow with AI

**For SBS:**
- Market differentiator: "Every graduate AI-literate"
- Implements published SAIL strategy
- Recruiting advantage
- Leadership in AI-era business education

**For ISOM:**
- Clear value in core curriculum
- Thought leadership opportunity
- Faculty professional development
- Sustainable departmental role

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

**Not:** "Another technical course everyone has to take"
**But:** "AI leadership for your major"

**Not:** "Learn to code in Python"
**But:** "Learn to direct AI tools and make ethical decisions"

**Not:** "Generic AI overview"
**But:** "Apply AI to marketing/finance/accounting/management/technical problems"

**Not:** "Separate tracks requiring complex coordination"
**But:** "One class with differentiated projects - simple and manageable"

---

## THE ASK

**Immediate:** ISOM department feedback and support

**Short-term:** Begin curriculum development and faculty preparation

**Medium-term:** Approval through curriculum process for Fall 2026 pilot

**Long-term:** Full integration as core requirement for all BSBA students

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (Year 1)

✅ 80%+ students report increased AI literacy
✅ Students demonstrate SAIL competencies in projects
✅ 85%+ student satisfaction with relevance to major
✅ Faculty feel adequately prepared and supported
✅ Course runs smoothly logistically

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**The Task Force identified declining relevance and automation risk.**

**We're proposing a course that teaches students to lead WITH AI, not compete against it.**

**Simple structure. Clear value. Implementable timeline.**

**Every Suffolk business graduate becomes AI-literate in their field.**

**That's genuine differentiation.**
